TODO: Use more robust command-line parsing than doing it manually
      (optparse and argparse)
      - Problem: Clutters code
      - Suggested solution: have some kind of class or several global functions
                            to wrap the version-dependent code
        - Problem: Makes code a little less readable.
TODO: Allow for PDF output (unsure of how to do this yet)
