NOTE: This project has been abandoned, due to lack of interest and the
realization that http://www.explainxkcd.com already provides a transcription of
the comics. In order to maintain a local copy of their wiki, I suggest using
https://github.com/moy/Git-Mediawiki

Downloads XKCD comics and saves them with their metadata.

The tool downloads the JSON for the specified comic and parses it.
It then saves the metadata in an HTML file, along with the image.
